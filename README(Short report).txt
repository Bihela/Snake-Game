My whole program is working except for the undo function because of a bug in my code. I implemented a genric linked list, my logic for the program was that the linked 
list stores the character that the user inputs for control (inserted into insert first) and when pressed undo it returns the last entered character (Stack behaviour).
Then for this returned last character, I wrote code for controls which have the opposite effect (eg - if the last entered character 'w' the code will activate the controls for A) thus technically storing the player and snake location and returning back to the original state. Unfotunately my linked list returns 'u' instead of the control character, I tried going to the next element too but that was also 'u' and so is all the elements. This is the bug in my program, has it not returned 'u' my undo function should also work fine.
